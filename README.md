## 🛠️ Installation

**✔️ Step 1:** Install npm and project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

**✔️ Step 2:** To view the project, you will need to run it using a local server, as the JSON file cannot be opened directly in a browser. Use the following command to start a local server:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```
In the correct route path, run:

```bash
http-server
```

And then, select in your console the port you would like to use. It will look something like this:
